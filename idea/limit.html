                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem of computers for children and their role in upbringing is very important issue. There is so much shit on the Internet that you need to control brain's food for your child much more carefully than the menu of his meal
                </p>
                <p>
                    China's law, which restricts computer games and social networks for more than 1 hour a day makes sense. In democratic countries, this law is impossible, and therefore I present different solution
                </p>
                <p>
                    "limit" is a computer or phone for kids with parental control 2.0
                </p>
                <p>
                    As manufacturers of these computers, we will compose a short description of all apps in the App Store. For example, about psychological impact, mental development and other parameters about games, Instagram, TikTok and other applications
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parent determines which applications are installed on the child's smartphone. The parent looks at detailed statistics on how the child uses them. The parent determines the time per day that the child can spend on social networks or games (for example, no more than half an hour) and our "limit" will simply ban using apps if child thies to enter them
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key benefits of "limit" will be its reward system. A computer and a smartphone for a child are sweeter than candies. You can reach an agreement with your child that if there are excellent grades in school this week - he will get unlimited access to all apps for the whole weekend; if there is grade of 2 - the access is closed; cleaning the house will add +2 hours for games, etc.
