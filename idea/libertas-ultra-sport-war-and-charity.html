                    “It's good that the war is so terrible, otherwise we would have liked it very much” - I don’t remember who said, but it is the real truth. The current concept of war has become obsolete. Why should we kill and smash if the coflict can be resolved on a different field of action?

                <p>
                    If nothing is achieved with diplomacy, then let conflict sides organize a sports tournament. A political olympiad is established: countries invite their best athletes - and they compete in boxing, cycling, chess, running, etc. The country that scores the most points and takes the object of conflict

                    Now you will not drag anyone into the war: the Internet has shown how beautiful the world is. We want to do a lot, we want to see a lot
                </p>
                <p>
                    To play the Olympics for the Crimea - huh? Sounds better then war conflict! Just imagine what a stir, what a gamble! And how much money will be spent not on multi-ton pieces of iron, which are designed to destroy, but on the sports development

                    With the new rules of the political game, such duels might be frequent, so it is necessary to create some leverage. The first is that in order to be challenged to a duel, the state must pay 5% of its GDP to the World Charitable Foundation. Second, the duel challenge cannot be ignored. Third, regulation the object of dispute

                    Belgium will not turn to France to take over its northern territories. Precisely, she will turn, but the institution considering such a claim, firstly, must make sure of adequate prerequisites (for example, it was once its historical possessions), and secondly, to hold a referendum among those who live on this territory - to find out if people are interested to be Belgium terrotory. If there is 80% support, then the tournament will be organized
                </p>
                <p>
                    The World Charitable Foundation is an institution that accepts money in these duels and then directs them to solve environmental problems of the Earth, to humanitarian aid or to fight hunger in third world countries
