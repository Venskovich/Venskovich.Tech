                    Libertas Ultra – smart polity. Elections according to the mind or How to keep clowns out of politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The generally accepted concept of democratic elections has not changed since the days of the Roman Empire. Libertas Ultra proposes to renew it, because this "democracy" voted politics are not the best, but the most artistic
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly, the new election policy is based on examinations. Do you want to be the Minister of Economy? Pass the exam in economics. Prove your competence
                </p>
                <p>
                    For better understanding the new electoral process, I will describe an example of one candidate Mark Grey. The gentleman is a businessman and professor of economic sciences who has applied for the post of Minister of Economy 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Mark receives an e-mail, witch exam inside on the economics discipline with questions that raise various topics of this comprehensive science. After passing the exam, a rating list is formed for all candidates, in which Mark takes 120th place among 10,000 participants
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second stage is also automated and does not require public speaking: to pay 1,000,000 to participate in the election race. The logic is simple: the smart person cannot be poor. Out of 10,000 participants, only 50 remain. Then the top 10 are selected in the rating list. The remaining 40 participants get their fee back
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third stage is the case study. Ten candidates are still isolated from publicity, but they receive special access and can study all the papers of the Ministry of Economy and attend any of its meetings, acting as an observer, not a participant in the processes. This is done so that candidates can study the affairs of the Ministry and draw up their own program of changes
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth stage is public speaking. Mark, like the other 9 candidates, is given 5 minutes to speak. During these 5 minutes, they describe their program of action and the tasks that they set for themselves for this post
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fifth stage is preliminary TV voting. The electorate is aware that the candidates have already passed the professional competence test, and now they have to choose the one who, due to their opinion, has the most interesting electoral program
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last stage is the final voting. Having chosen the five most interesting candidates, they answer the questions of the electorate in the format of an online show. Then voting and announcement of the winner. Millions of candidates' contributions go to the winner in the form of a prize fund
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Summary:</b> Libertas Ultra – smart polity, which has smart elections. We vote for the most competent, not artistic, person for important government posts, and we can be sure that we have chosen the best
