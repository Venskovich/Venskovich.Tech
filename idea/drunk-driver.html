                    How to reduce accidents with drunk drivers by 100%
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Briefly, when a driver gets into a car, he needs to pass a quick test of reaction. The test results are instantly sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and if the results are low, then we can conclude that the driver is extremely tired, drunk, under strong medicine or drugs
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is this test? An app on a smartphone. It includes 3 mini-games for attention, thinking speed and memory. Low results will limit your driving
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if a driver passed the test for 75/100, then he is prohibited from driving faster than 90km/h on roads outside the city, including highways. If the test results is 65/100, the speed limit is 70km/h and is permitted to drive only the right lane. If the results is below 50/100, then driving is prohibited
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of disobedience, an urgent police detachment is sent in pursuit and a fine of $100 is charged for each kilometer of the driven distance
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to track whether the car engine is launched and whether the test has been passed, each driver will need to connect a transmitter to the car, which will record this information. If the car starts to move, and the test fails, the algorithm of actions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is the same as in the above described case
