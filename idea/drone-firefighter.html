                    Drones as firefighters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If someone does not know, there are such small balls that, when thrown into a fire, explode under the temperature influence and spray powder, which, in turn, extinguishes the fire. Excellent technology and very effective: you can see this by watching a couple of videos
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are called: "autonomous sphere of powder fire extinguishing"
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fire is a disaster that requires an immediate response. 911 employees do it, but call response rate can be accelerated with drones
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we add a box with 4-6 balls to the drone, which are ready to be thrown into the fire? The fire can probably be extinguished before the 911 arrives
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drone has a huge advantage over the 911 car: it flies in a straight line, bypassing all road traffic and can reach speed up to 90km/h - it is not difficult to estimate that the arrival speed to a call with a drone can be 2 times higher
                </p>
                <p>
                    What remains: someone of observers or who who called 911, must throw the balls into the fire and then wait for the the 911 car arrival
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the field is on fire, drones-bombers could even be developed. These balls will be in their bomb bay. Unlike a drone, the speed of a drone-bomber can reach 300 km/h, so the advantage over cars is obvious
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is another concept: a drone with a cannon. Unlike a drone case with a box, which requires the participation of third parties, a drone with a cannon flies to the window and fires a ball through it. The ball soon extinguishes the fire. Probably, such a cannon mechanism will be single-shot, so a flight crew of several drones can be raised to a call
