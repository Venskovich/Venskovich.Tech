                    Libertas Ultra – smart polity. Ministry of Aesthetics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Libertas Ultra is about a beautiful state, which parks were designed by world famous landscape and light designers; which cities have its own architectural style and strictly follows it; this is when street graffiti artists are not chased, but offered a job, thereby developing monumental painting
                </p>
                <p>
                    To decorate the country, to develop a spirit of creativity in it is not easy task. This is the task of an entire institution, and therefore it is necessary to establish a new ministry - the Ministry of Aesthetics
                </p>
                <p>
                    Houses and buildings, distinguished by their architecture, attract thousands of tourists, and architecturally beautiful cities become the dream of those who would like to live in such place untill death. The task of the Ministry of Aesthetics is to highlight key features in each city and develop it. Thus, architects simply will not be able to obtain approval for a project if the facade of their building is different from the prescribed standards for the number of floors and the architectural style of the street
                </p>
                <p>
                    The activities of this Ministry will even affect the clothes of law enforcement agencies, doctors and road workers - their uniforms should be the best creation of designers. The uniform should be so beautiful that, looking at it, you immediately want to become a doctor and proudly wear it
                </p>
                <p>
                    The importance of beauty is grossly underestimated. A beautiful picture leads a person into breathtaking delight. And staying in a beautiful place pacifies his soul and makes a person happy. The diversity and greatness of what he saw develops creativity in a person: he involuntarily wants to create. Imagine how many new ideas will be born on such a land and what progress there will be!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Summary:</b> Libertas Ultra never forgets about the beautiful - this is part of human needs, and it must certainly and impeccably be satisfied in the best possible way
