                <p>
                    There are many charitable foundations (further - CF) in modern states. However, they are all scattered and even forced to compete with each other. It cannot be called a rare phenomenon that the CF is established primarily for self-promotion in political activities or for other personal purposes
                </p>
                <p>
                    This activity exists, but its money turnover is negligible in comparison with the request for help from those who need it. In addition, charity is not popular in society: the manifestation of social responsibility is negligible compared to its potential
                </p>
                <p>
                    Libertas Ultra promotes the creation of a Unified Charitable Foundation - it will unite the efforts of all funds in the country, eliminate cynical self-promotion, and will be a powerful organization with huge resources that will not bypass anyone in need
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charity needs to be a mandatory tax on the working population. Even if you give $5 a year, this is a enormous amount of money (in case of Ukraine, it is $100 million), which can solve these problems at once: nutrition and care in orphanages, expensive treatment of a group of people, as well as shelter, clothing and food for homeless people and street animals
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, casinos can be involved. In some country, I heard for a case that all casinos and bookmakers belong to the state, and the profits from them go to charity. An excellent idea: there are no flaws in it, therefore can be considered as a part of this reform of the "United CF"
