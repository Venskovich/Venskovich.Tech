The own website I used to publish different stuff:
- The projects I've implemented as bots in Telegram. Only those, which were running online that time. I represented them with messages blocks as it is in the messanger
- Art Gallery - my own art gallery of the paintings I ever liked and saved
- Ideas - my own blog of different ideas I've got
- Achivements - I wanted to save somehow the goals I've achieved
